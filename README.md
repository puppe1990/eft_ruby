EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques)
EFT is a type of psychological therapy that involves tapping on specific points on the body while focusing on negative emotions or physical sensations. It is based on the idea that negative emotions and physical sensations are caused by imbalances in the body's energy system, and that tapping on specific points can help to restore balance and reduce these negative emotions or sensations.

During an EFT session, a person typically begins by identifying a specific issue or emotion that they want to work on. They then tap on a series of points on their body while focusing on the issue and repeating specific phrases to themselves. The points that are tapped on are known as "tapping points" and are located on the face, hands, and upper body.

EFT is often used to help people overcome a wide range of emotional and physical issues, such as anxiety, stress, phobias, and chronic pain. It is believed to be a safe and effective treatment option, and research has shown that it can be helpful in reducing symptoms and improving overall well-being.
